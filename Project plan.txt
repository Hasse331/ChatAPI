### Project: Real-Time Chat Microservice API
**Tech Stack:**
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Socket.io (for real-time communication)
- Express (for RESTful API endpoints)
- MongoDB (for storing chat data and user information)
- JWT or OAuth (for user authentication)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

**Description:**
Build a real-time chat microservice that provides an API for other applications to integrate chat functionalities. The service will handle user authentication, message storage, and real-time message broadcasting.

### Features and Endpoints:
1. **User Authentication:**
   - Endpoint to authenticate users and generate tokens (using JWT or OAuth).
   - Middleware to validate tokens on protected endpoints.

2. **Chat Rooms:**
   - Endpoint to create a new chat room.
   - Endpoint to fetch all available chat rooms.
   - Endpoint to join a specific chat room.

3. **Messages:**
   - Endpoint to fetch previous messages in a chat room.
   - Real-time functionality to send and receive messages using Socket.io.

4. **User Management:**
   - Endpoint to fetch all online users in a specific chat room.
   - Real-time updates when a user joins or leaves a chat room.

### Key Concepts:
- **Real-time Communication:** Use Socket.io to implement real-time messaging. Understand the WebSocket protocol.
- **User Authentication:** Implement secure user authentication and token generation.
- **Database Management:** Use MongoDB to store chat messages, user data, and chat room information. Implement proper indexing for efficient data retrieval.
- **Error Handling:** Create a robust error handling mechanism to deal with issues gracefully.
- **API Design:** Design RESTful API endpoints that are intuitive and easy to use.

### Tips and Best Practices:
1. **Modular Code:** Structure your code in a modular fashion, separating concerns like authentication, database interactions, and real-time functionality.

2. **Documentation:** Clearly document your API endpoints, request/response structures, and any authentication requirements.

3. **Security:** Ensure that your application is secure, especially the user authentication part. Use HTTPS to encrypt data during transit.

4. **Testing:** Write tests for your API endpoints and real-time functionality to ensure everything works as expected.

5. **Scalability:** Design your application with scalability in mind. Consider how it will handle a large number of simultaneous connections and messages.

6. **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement proper logging and monitoring to keep track of any issues and to understand the usage patterns of your service.

7. **Dockerization (Optional):** Consider containerizing your application using Docker. This makes it easier to deploy and scale your service.

8. **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of your API.

### Project Timeline (1 Week):
- **Day 1-2:** Setup project structure, implement user authentication, and set up MongoDB.
- **Day 3-4:** Implement chat room creation, joining, and message sending/receiving functionality.
- **Day 5:** Work on user management and real-time updates for user presence.
- **Day 6:** Implement API documentation, error handling, and write tests.
- **Day 7:** Final testing, debugging, and deployment preparations.

By the end of the week, you should have a fully functional real-time chat microservice that can be integrated with other applications. Remember that the timeline is an estimate, and the actual time required might vary depending on various factors.
